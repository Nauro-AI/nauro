    Several store/resolution paths walk up from `Path.cwd()` looking for
    ``.nauro/config.json``. If pytest is run from inside an adopted repo
    (e.g. the nauro repo dogfood-adopting itself), that walk finds a real
    config and trips ID-mismatch errors in tests that pass project_id= directly.
    Tests that need a specific CWD use monkeypatch.chdir themselves; their
    later override wins on the same monkeypatch instance.
